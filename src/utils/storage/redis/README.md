# Redis Storage Module Structure

This document explains the modular structure of the Redis storage implementation, which has been divided into smaller components for better maintainability and readability.

## File Structure

1. **redis_storage.py** (41 lines)
   - Main module that combines all functionality through inheritance
   - Imports all other modules and provides the public interface

2. **redis_storage_base.py** (108 lines)
   - Base class with initialization, core Redis operations
   - Connection handling and basic utility methods
   - Redis key pattern definitions

3. **redis_storage_season.py** (181 lines)
   - Season-related operations (`add_season`, `get_season`, etc.)
   - Season validation and processing
   - Season sorting and organization

4. **redis_storage_designer.py** (169 lines)
   - Designer-related operations (`add_designer`, `get_designer`, etc.)
   - Designer validation and processing

5. **redis_storage_look.py** (206 lines)
   - Look and image-related operations (`add_look`, etc.)
   - Image validation and processing

6. **redis_storage_compatibility.py** (159 lines)
   - Compatibility methods for JSON storage interface
   - Implements methods like `read_data`, `write_data`, etc.
   - Temporary file handling for compatibility

7. **redis_storage_progress.py** (102 lines)
   - Progress tracking and metadata updates
   - Calculation of completion statistics

## Usage

To use this implementation, simply import and instantiate the `RedisStorageHandler` class from `redis_storage.py`:

```python
from src.utils.storage.redis_storage import RedisStorageHandler

# Create a Redis storage handler
storage = RedisStorageHandler(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379,
    db=0,
    password=None,
    checkpoint_id=None
)

# Use the storage handler just like the original implementation
storage.add_season(season_data)
storage.add_designer(designer_data, season, year)
storage.add_look(designer_url, look_number, images)
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a mixin pattern to separate functionality into logical components while still presenting a unified interface. The `RedisStorageHandler` class inherits from all the mixin classes to combine their functionality.

Each mixin provides a specific set of related methods, keeping the code modular and maintainable. This design makes it easier to find and modify specific parts of the implementation without affecting the rest.

## Compatibility

This implementation maintains full compatibility with the original storage interface, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the JSON storage handler.
